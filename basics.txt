1. What is the Time Complexity of reading an element from array
ans: O(n)

2. What is  the time Complexity for inserting or deleting a element in the middle of array
ans: O(1)

3. If we have a random linked list. which one is the best algorithm to sort the linked list
    - What is the Time complexity of that algorithm
ans:Merge Sort Time Complexity O(n log n)

4. What if there is no data structure available to you like arrays and if you have to create a queue then in this situation how many stacks are needed?
ans: 2 Stack needed for queue implementation

5. What happens when we add a duplicate key in hashmap?
ans: it will replace the element of the corresponding key.

6. Can we delete the middle element from the odd length stack?
    1. If yes? How do we implement that
ans: length = 5 divide by 2 so 2nd index remove element 

7. How can we limit the character of a decimal number upto 2 without using any libraries?
ans:To format a number using fixed-point notation, you can simply use the toFixed method:
    (10.8).toFixed(2); // "10.80"


8. Can we create a circular linked list with a doubly linked list? If yes, how can we create it?
ans: yes, in which we put the address of first node in last node address

9. Which data structure is used in the recursive function to store the return address of the recursive function.
ans: in this we have to use STACK LIFO principle

10. Why does the overflow happen in hashing?
ans: An overflow occurs when the home bucket for a new pair (key, element) is full.

11. What is the time complexity of nested for loop?
ans: O(n2)
